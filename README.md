The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One reason that the wreck prompted such death toll was that there were insufficient rafts for the passengers and crew. In spite of the fact that there was some component of luck involved in surviving the sinking, a few gatherings of individuals will probably make due than others, for example women, children and the upper class.I want to finish the analysis of what sorts of individuals were probably going to survive. In particular, we will apply some machine learning techniques to predict which passengers survived the tragedy and select the classifier which has the highest accuracy.
